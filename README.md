### Hey there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I’m [**Ghulam Mustafa**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ghulam-mustafa-38a1b9239/), a full stack software engineer with 3+ years of experince, based in Pakistan.

I love to observe, design and build applications that helps to solve the real world problems.

If an idea pops into my head, chances are I’ll build it and ship it.

My main frontend techstack is react, typescript, tailwind, and Vue.js (currently mastering).

My go-to backend techstack is laravel, Django and FastAPI. 

I am proficient in Databases including: MySQL, MongoDB, PostgresSQL, Redis, mariaDB and elasticSearch. 

My favorite tools are Notion, apple notes, and my personal diary (you donot want to see).

I am currently mastering DevOps. That is the main goal I have for 2026 and ofcourse building my personal github profile (so it matches my steller and diverse experience). 

I’ve built over 100 repos, but privately.. it’s probably more than 200 at this point.

#### Fun Facts:

* I am a Movieholic and full time Cinephile. You name a movie, I would know it.
* I don’t drink coffee or tea. Still finds ways to stay pro-active.
* Suits is my favorite season. Some people call me the engineer version of Harvey Specter (because I like to boil things down to fundamentals). 
* **Hobbies:** football/soccer, running, travelling. Might hit the gym as well at some point.
