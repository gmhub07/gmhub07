### Hey there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I’m [**Ghulam Mustafa**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ghulam-mustafa-38a1b9239/), a full stack software engineer with 2+ years of experince, based in Pakistan.

I love to observe, design and build applications that helps to solve the real world problems.

If an idea pops into my head, chances are I’ll build it and ship it.

My main frontend techstack is react, typescript, tailwind, and Vue.js (currently mastering).

My go-to backend techstack is laravel, Django and FastAPI. 

I am proficient in Databases including: MySQL, MongoDB, PostgresSQL, Redis, mariaDB and elasticSearch. 

My favorite tools are Notion, apple notes, and my personal diary (you donot want to see).

Currently focusing on mastering the realm of DevOps and building my personal github profile. 

I’ve built over 100 repos, but privately.. it’s probably more than 200 at this point.

#### Fun Facts:

* I am a Movieholic and full time Cinephile. You name a movie, I would know it.
* I don’t drink tea. Just coffee only in winters.
* Suits is my favorite season. Harvey Specter vibes only. 
* **Hobbies:** football/soccer, running, and love of travelling.
